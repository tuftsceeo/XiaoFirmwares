# About:
We compiled some custom firmware for some boards. In each folder, you can find instructions on how to install the firmware. 
# Disclaimer:
You are more likely to find the latest firmware on either the vendor's website or official micropython website. Some of the libraries may not work the way you expect. If you find any bugs please report them to milan.dahal@tufts.edu
